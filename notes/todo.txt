* Nothing verifies the correct return values of print_char, print_nv_string
* No return value comes from the other primitive formatters
* Add test suites for output formatters?
* Matchers and values for stdint.h types
* Determine what issues const might play in values, matchers, and mocks
* Auto-mocking
* Better Makefile modeled after my Unity/CMock one
    Make it faster by allowing some test binaries to share object files?
* Attempt to port some test suites for real projects from Unity/CMock to pfstest
* Decide on whether to rename output_formatters to something with "reporter" in the name, since they also manage the return value for the program
* Actually, should they be managing the return value for the program?
* Is the number of failures a poor choice for the return value to begin with? What does Unity return on failure?
* Move platforms into separate headers
* Is my use of uintptr_t, intmax_t, uintmax_t and ULONG_MAX incompatible with my assertion that I support C89?
