arrays of each of these


ctypes-based matchers?


Unity matchers:

equal ints, various sizes
equal uints, various sizes
equal uints with hex printing, various sizes
not equal
whether certain bits are set, clear, or equal a mask in another int
greater than, various integer sizes, signednesses, and hexnesses
less than, various integer sizes, signednesses, and hexnesses
within, various integer sizes, signednesses, and hexnesses
equal pointers
equal strings
equal snstrings
equal memory
equal int arrays, various sizes, signednesses, and hexnesses
equal pointer arrays
equal string arrays
equal memory arrays
arrays where all elements match an int of various sizes, signednesses, and hexnesses
arrays where all elements match a pointer
arrays where all elements match a string
arrays where all elements match a memory buffer

within, floats (printing should include +/- inf, NaN)
array of floats within

within, doubles
array of doubles within

Hamcrest matchers:

array containing an element
array containing certain elements in order
object whose value is in an array (thing that an any() combinator can do this)
allOf()
anyOf()
Attach a different message string
every item in an array matches one matcher
is anything
is equal (this is the is_the_<basic type> suite)
is null (is_the_pointer(NULL) -- but maybe a convenience wrapper?)
stringContains
stringEndsWith
stringStartsWith
substring
isCloseTo
isNaN
comparesEqualTo
greaterThan
greaterThanOrEqualTo
lsssThan
lessThanOrEqualTo
isBlankString (only whitespace)
isEmptyString ("") -- these two also match NULL
isEqualIgnoringCase
isEqualIgnoringWhitespace
matchesPattern (regex)
stringContainsInOrder
