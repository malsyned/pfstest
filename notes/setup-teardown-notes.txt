Before I can consider setup/teardown complete:

pfstest_case was designed to make it possible to write test cases that weren't auto-registered and that didn't have before or after hooks automatically connected to them.

With the new setup/teardown system, those functions are not being auto-registered in pfstest-core.h indiscriminately. As a result, test-assert-that.c and test-mock.c haven't been cut over to using setup() for their before-test code, since that would break the pfstest-case definitions in those files.

Some change to pfstest_case will have to be devised.

After that, before and after hooks should be removed from all APIs.

****************

pfstest(), pfstest_case(), and pfstest_ignore_test() serve only to set flags and then call _pfstest_case_define or _pfstest_define.

_pfstest_define just serves to call _pfstest_case_define after creating a constructor.


I need two things:

pfstest_case(name) and pfstest_case_with_fixture(name).

pfstest_case(name) eventually passes NULL, NULL to _pfstest_object
pfstest_case_with_fixture(name) eventually passes &__pfstest_setup_ptr, &__pfstest_teardown_ptr to _pfstest_object.
