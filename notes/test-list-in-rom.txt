Plan:

Create a special section name that matches *(.progmem*) and won't collide with filenames if possible.

Use attributes to arrange for function pointers to be stored in that section.

Find some way to get the start and end addresses of that section into symbols.
Point of interest: putting a linker script on the command line mixed in with object names causes it to augment the existing linker script. Perhaps this is how to get the symbols I want defined?


Loop from the start to the end, calling those functions.
