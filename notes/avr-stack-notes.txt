My technique for monitoring the size of the stack is to fill the rest of the stack with 0xa5



Fill from __heap_start to STACK_POINTER() with 0xba

At the end of the program, search from RAMEND backward until you find four 0xba in a row.

Subtract that address from RAMEND. That is how much stack you have used.
Then keep searching until you find four not 0xba in a row.
Subtract __heap_start from that. That is how much malloc you used.
